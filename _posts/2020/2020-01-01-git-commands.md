We have numerous sources and manage it using source control management(SCM) DevOps tools like Git, SubVersion, CVS, TFS, ClearCase, Mercurial. Git is a modern distributed version control system. I am going to tell you most useful Git commands and why we need to use those commands. I will explain each step with examples.

| Git Command Line Tools is consistent | | There are 3 states of Git. |
| ------------ |-----| ------------ |
| - Terminal on Mac/Linux  |  |  - Working directory |
